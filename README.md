# Coffee-and-Wifi-Database
This website keeps a track of places where you get coffee and wifi in the area along with its rating, helping others to find a spot to work from. This website is made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask, Jinja and WTForms. To add a place you have to go to the "/add" route manually so that its not open for everyone and only for the Devs.
